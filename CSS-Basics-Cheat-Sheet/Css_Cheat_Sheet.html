<!-- There are 3 main methords that you can use to add CSS,
	They are:
	1. Inline Css
	2. Internal Css
	3. External Css

In inline Css, you add the Css code, directly into the html elements and tags. This means that you write the Css code, while writing the HTML and the css code is written within the tags name (<tag Css_code> content </tags.). This is exactly like adding attributes to tags . This is a big NO!. When designing a webpage, it is important to seperate the HTML presentation parts from the Css Styling parts, and by using this methord, we are actually mixing both things, which is inefficient, unpractical and forbidden when designing webpages.

The next methord is Internal Css, where you use <style> tags in the 
<head> parts of your HtML code. This is much better than Inline Css as it seperated style form the presentation. However, it is not the recomended methord. This is because, any Css that you write can only be aplicable to that documnet only and cannot be reused in other documents. Also writing Css code in your document adds more data into your document, which ends up taking more memory for one HtML file on your computer.

The third option of External Css is the best of all three. It involves making a completely different .css file and linking the file where you wrote your html in, to it. This is better because it seperates the presentaion and styling, while also allowing you to reuse that Css in other HtmL documents -->



<!-- Any Css that you write with the tag name as the selector, That Css will apply to all tags with that name -->

<!-- If you have multiple tags of the same type in your HTML code and you want to write special Css for each of them, then you have to specify an attribute called 'id' for each tag. Think of this as giving a name to each tag and when you want to write Css for indivisual tags, we use mention the id attribute of the tag to specify which one -->

<!-- All Css styling for any tag follow the same format and it is as follows (By the way when we write some style for a tag, it is called a declaration and is enclosed within curley braces):
	a {background-color: yellow;}
	selector {property: value};

When you are writing a Css for a certain tag, we enclose all the styles for that tag within a set of curley braces. A style is divided into 2 parts: a property and a value. Here the property is 'background-colour' and the value is 'yellow'. All property-value pair are seperated by a colin(:). After writing we the property-value pair we type a semicolin(;) to specify the end of a style. We write the tag name/id before the curley braces and this part is called the selector -->

<!-- Colours in Css
	We can add styling to elements in the form of colours, using css. There are 2 main properties that we can use to specify what element we desire to change the colour of, and the two properies are:

	1. color (Note that the American spelling is used here)
	This property specifies the colour of a certain element/tag


	2. background-color ((Note that the American spelling is used here))
	This is used to specify the background colour behind a certain element/tag

	These properties have some corresponding values. However, Whatever format/type values they do have, they are the exact same format/type values, as they are pretty much the exact same properity. There are 3 main ways we can specify the values for these properties, i.e there are 3 main ways we can specify our desired colour for the color/background-color properties in css:
	1. Using the HTML5 colour names
	If we want to use this methord, we just write the colour name after the property and colon in lower case letters
	HTML5 has some default common colour names for some predefined colours (such as blue for, well... blue!) we may use these predefined colours if desired, however, every possible colour that you could use is not given a html colour name, so if you want a unique colour that is not given a html then you can't use this methord. Also it is immpossible to memorise the names of every colour in HTMl 5, so this methord is only useful, when you want basic colours. 

	2. Using hexadecimal
	If we want to use this methord, we write in this format #FFFFFF
	where in place of the 6 f's we just put the html colour code,and the hashtag stays the same. We write this value right after the property and the colon.
	Check your igcse grade 9 and 10 text book for this explanation

	3. Using RGB
	If we want to use this methord, we write in this format rgb(a, b, c) where a, b, c are the numbers from 0 to 255 and the rgb and bracets stays the same. The a represents the amount of red. The b represents the amount of green. The c represents the amount of blue

	Any colour in the world can be represented as a combination of Red, Green and Blue (RGB), so in this methord, in order to represent colours, we represent the amount of red , green and blue respectively within that colour. The numbers a, b, c that we enter in the brackets represent how much shades of each colour is used and these numbers go up to 255. The idea behind this is exaclty like that of the hexadecimal except the hexadecimal number, we are just coverting to decimal values.

 -->

<!-- Fonts in Css
	With the help of CSS we can change the fonts of the text that we produced. This can be used to make text more stylish. When adding fonts for a text, we use the property 'font-family' and the value of this property is gonna be the name of the font. In Css, there are going to be some predefined fonts, built into the system, and these are called web safe fonts. We can only use websafe fonts when writing Css and if we need more fonts, we should use resources like google fonts, and link in those fonts to our webpage, kinda like how we link in our style sheet.

	In order to change the font size in CSS, we use the property, font-size, and the corresponding value will the size of the font in pixels (60px).

	In order to give boldness to fonts, we use the property font-weight, and the corresponding value will be the either the string 'bold', 'normal' etc. or a number, to indicate the intensity of boldness

	Finally, we can also change line height of text using css also. This is done using the property line-height, and the corresponding values to this is either the line height in pixels or the line height in em. em is a unit of lenght measurement in Css, usually 16px = 1 em, however that may vary from place to place because em is converted to pixels based on a formula that uses constatnts (Like the general common value of pixels used in that place), whose values change place to place. -->

<!-- Classes and Ids in HTML:
	1) An ID in HTML is an atribute that can be added to tags in order to uniquely identify them from other tages. Like a regular everyday id that we wear, adding an id in HTML allows us to specially refer/identify to a specific tag in the HTML code, even though there may be mulitple tags of that tag. For instance, let us assume that in my webpage, I have multiple paragraphs present that I wrote using the <p> tag. In order to give Css styling to a specific paragraph, I will need to refer to the <p> tag that corresponds to that paragraph uniquely, when I am giving it styling. Therefore, in order to do that I will need to give the tag a special id. On an important note: We can/should only add an id to one and ONLY one HTML tag only, this is part of the definition if an id, it is added to only one HTML tag and you don't repeat ids. Anyway To add id in HTML, we add it like we add any other attribute (since id is techincally an attribute) and we do it as follows
		<tag id="id_name">
	Pretty simple stuff. Also to add styling to a specific tag using CSS, we need to specify the id of that tag. To do that, when we are writing a CSS statement in the form- selector {property: value}; , we need to write #id_name in place of the selector, i.e to refer to a specific id in CSS we write #id_name
	Also note that we can use a <div> to encompass a bunch of tags and give an id for that one div tag. This makes it so that all the tags within that div tag now all can have the properties that we wrote for the div tag and techincally all these tags under the div tag have the same id, but don't get that confused with multiple spereate elements not in the same div tag having the same id, this scenario is wrong.

	2) A Class in HTML is also an attribute that can be added to tags, and also uniquely identifies multiple different tages i.e it uniquely identifies a set of tags. Just like how in our daily life, we can seperate objects into unique classes in order to single out those specific things, we can assign to many tags (even tags of different types like a <p> tag and a <h1> tag) a specifc class attribute, so that all tags that fall under that specific tag will be refered to. For instance, if I am writing a blog webpage in which I will have multiple paragraphs which I will write in my code with a <p> tag, instead of giving a unique id for each <p> tag and reffering to each one indivisually, I can give a single same class for all paragraphs, so I can refer to all of them at once. Therefore if I need to give some CSS styling to all the paragraphs then I can just write the CSS once while reffering to the class of all blog paragraphs and the CSS styling will automatically apply to all the paragraphs within the class of blog paragraphs. We can/should only add a class multiple HTML tags, this is part of the definition if a class, it is added to many HTML tags. Anyway to specify the class for a group of tags we write it as follows
		<tag class="class_name">
	Now to add styling to the set of all tags with a give class name (such as class_name) we have to write a CSS statement. As you may know all CSS statements take the form- selector {property: value};, and to refer to a certain class when we are writing the CSS, we we need to write .clas_name in place of the selector, i.e to refer to a specific class in CSS we write .class_name, the rest part is just basic CSS that you know. Also as a note any tag in HTML can have a class and infact it can also have more than just one class. This makes it so that the for all the CSS styling that we define for each class a tag is a part of, all that styling will apply to that tag. Now to give a tag multiple classes we write it as follows
		<tag class='class1 class2 class3'
	Notice that I kept spaces between the class names, this is how you specify multiple classes for a tag, you keep as space between then and this fact is important becuase if for instance you wrote a class name as <tag class='class name'> (Notice that we kept as space between the class and name) then you would have mistakenly specifed two seperate classes for the tag, one being 'class' and the other being 'name' and inorder to prevent that we place an underscore between the two words so that there is no space. remeber no space when naming a class, only when nameing muliple different classes for a specifc tag. Keep this in mind to avoid confusion. -->

<!-- The box model of CSS

	So any and all content in HTML can be visualied with/compared to having a 'box' sorrounding it (See image posted above), in fact when we do write HTML all elements actually do automatically get this box around them. This virtual 'box' is called the box model in CSS and is an important part when it comes to designing and styling the area aound a piece of content.This virtual box consists of servaral layers that sorround the content and they are
	1. The Padding
	2. The Border
	3. The Margin

	1. The Padding: The area of empty space in the webiste that is sorrounding/around the content and that extends from the outermost edge of the content to the start of the content border is called padding. Put simply padding is basically the white space that is between the content and the border. Padding can be changed with CSS and can be increased or decreased in order to make the layout of the content in the webpage look more appealing. By default a few elements have padding, however CSS can change the amount of padding given to an element. The synax in CSS used to specify padding is written on the styling part of this document that is linked above. The important thing to note here is that there are 4 places where padding can be inserted relative to the content, they are top, right, bottom, and left (Pretty obvious) and each of the padding properties present on these 4 seperate places can be uniquly changed to give the best look. Remeber padding has no colour and is just the space around an element, so no specifying colour. Also when giving padding for a certain content, keep in mind that you also need to keep a border and a margin so you have to leave some space for those as well. Also note that adding padding, like the rest of these, is truly optional and is not necessary

	1. The Border: The coloured line that runs around the edge a certain piece of content with padding and extends from the end of the padding to ther start of the margin is called the border. Like the commmon definition of a border, a border in CSS sorrounds the content with padding and is basically for styling purpose. When we are writing a border for a certain content in CSS, we need to specify ther border width/thickness, the border colour, and finally ther border type (whether it is dotted, dashed, solid border etc. ). By default no element gets a border and must be specifed by CSS. The synax in CSS used to specify border is written on the styling part of this document that is linked above. Like padding, there are also 4 specific locations where one can add bordering relative to the content with padding, they are the top, right, bottom and left and of course like padding, each of these can be changed uniquely. Finally, when you are adding a border, be sure to leave some place around the border so that you may change the margins around them if you wish to do so.

	3. The Margin: The margin is the blank white space that begins from the outermost edge of the border and ends at the edge of the webpage. Basically the margin specifies the outermost area of the content i.e empty space outside the border but inside the webpage. Margin can be changed with CSS and can be increased or decreased in order to make the layout of the content in the webpage look more appealing. By default a few elements have Margin, however CSS can change the amount of Margin given to an element. The synax in CSS used to specify margin is written on the styling part of this document that is linked above and is more or less exactly the same format of CSS syntax used for padding. Just like padding there are 4 places where margin can be inserted relative to the content, they are top, right, bottom, and left (Pretty obvious) and each of the margin properties present on these 4 seperate places can be uniquly changed to give the best look. Unlike a border, and just like padding, margin has no colour and is just the space around an element, so no specifying colour. Note that margin is the last area of space around a content accoring to box model and is therefore the last place where you can specify spacing around elemnts. You do not have to leave any extra space to accomodate for any extra properties that define space around a content.

	Note: A few HTML elements have some sort of default Padding and/or Magrin around them. Any Padding/Margin that we specify in CSS, gets added on top of that existing Padding/Margin. If we do not wish to have this pre-existing Padding/Margin on any element for any reason (Can be to prevent confusion, or to make it look neater etc.), we can do what is called a 'reset'. A 'reset' basically removes all the default Padding/Margins for every single element by converting every element's esisting Padding/Margin to 0. The syntax for doing this is written written on the styling part of this document that is linked above and it basically involves referring to all the tags in the HTML document by using a special symbol called an asterisk (*), then specifying all the Padding/Margin to be zero.
-->

<!-- Css syntax for lists
	Using CSS we can apply styling to lists as well. Since there are 2 types of lists (ordered and unordered) that we can use in HTML, the Css syntax for ordered and unordered lists is a bit different, however in this course, we will be working with and looking at the CSS styling for unordered lists only. The main type of CSS styling that one can apply for unordered lists is changing the shape of the bullet points. By default the shape of the bullet points is a circle, however, the shape of the bullet points can be changed, this also includes placing no bullet point infront of the list item, as well as including an image as the bullet point. The syntax to do so is written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above. 
-->

<!-- Using Css to customise hyperlinks
	Just like every other element and tag, we can cusomise hyperlink elements (<a> tags) using CSS. However, unlinke every other element, the hyperlink element can exist in differnt states, and therefore, CSS can be written for each of these different states, to customise each state. The states in a hyperlink occur everytime the cursor interacts with the hyperlink, for instance, when the mouse hovers over the hyperlink, the link enters the 'hover' state and when we click on the hyperlink, it becomes the active state. Thus since a hyperlink can exist in these many different states, it is important to specify which state we are changing the properties for, when we write CSS for the hyperlink. The actual code for doing this is written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above.
-->

<!-- CSS styling for forms
	CSS can customise many elements including forms. The syntax for writing CSS for forms is not too new, and is simply just like the CSS we've been writing all this time.
	We can write CSS for each of the fields by keeping a specific field as the selector, and writing CSS for that field to change it's properties. One new thing to note here is that for certain tags, like the input tag, there are certain attributes that the tag can have, for instance the input tag can have the attribute type=text , due to this, we can write CSS for a tag under a specific attribute, so that only when the tag has that specific attribute to, the CSS properties that we typed will be applied to the tag. The specific CSS syntax for this is written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above. The other important thing to keep in mind is that the imput tag with attribute type=submit produces a button that can be used to submit the form. We can think of this submit button as a hyperlink to submit the form and as such, can exist in many states as well, due to this it is possible and important to specify the state of the submit button we want for the CSS to apply. The actual code for doing this is written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above.

<!-- Alignment and floating
	In CSS all the new elements that we type in a webpage automatically gets added on a new line, if it is a block level element, or gets continued in the same line if it is an inline element. This is called the normal flow or natural layout of the webpage (flow is another word for layout in CSS). If for instance we want *one paticular block level element to be placed to the immediate right side of another block level element(instead of being placed below it), then we can do this by changing it's display property to inline using CSS. However if we want every elements that follows the initial block level element to be placed on the right side of it, (even if it is a block level element), then we have to change the normal flow of the webpage. We need to change the flow of the webpage such that any new element that gets added to it's automatically gets placed to the right of the elements following the original block level element. If we wanted to do the same thing but have every elements that follows the initial block level element to be placed on the left side of it, we would need to do the same thing i.e alter the normal flow of the webpage. This is done by changing the float property. The float property in a nutshell is Ca SS property that places an element on the left or right side of its container (Here container means the webpage or the over-arching/main div block that sorrounds the html of the body), allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. An example use of the float property is for wrapping elements around images. The CSS syntax for floating elements to the right or left is on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above.

	Normally when specifying width of an element in CSS, only the horizontal distance that the element takes up without any padding, border or margin is considered as the the width of an element in CSS. This means that whenever you are specifying the width of an element, any padding, border and margin that you add on to that element, is not considered as a part of the as the width of the element and it adds to the existing specified width of the element. To change this, and make it so that any paddng, border and margin that we add gets counted as a part of the width of an element, we can change the property 'box-sizing' using CSS and give it the value of 'border-box'.
	This changes it so that the width of an element now gets considered as the horizontal distance that the element takes up with padding, border or margin.

<!-- Setting up an image backround in CSS
	Just like how we can change the background colour of an element in CSS, one can also place an image as the background of an element with CSS. There are also certain styling that we can apply to the background image that we keep, such as changing the position of the background image, or removing the repitition of the image when it is too small or when it is positioned to go outside of the borders (Basically the image repeats it's self vertically and horizonatlly to conver any blank uncovered space that esists). The code for doing this is written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above.

<!-- Positioning in CSS
	In CSS, It is possible to change the position of an element on the webpage i.e instead of an element being displayed naturally accoring to the order it has been coded (Normal flow), we can manually manipulate the position of the element to where ever we want in CSS. To change the position of an element we must specify the type of positioning we want the element to undergo, as there are many ways we can specify position of an element. Once that is done, then only can we actually code the exact position where we want the element to be. The type of position of an element is specified using the 'position' property, which can have the following values;

	1) Static - This is the default value of this property and positions the element accoring to it's default position, which is accoring to the natural flow of the webpage. Every element except the body tag has this as the default property
	2) Relative - Now this property doesn't change the position of the element specifally, and just positions it to it's default value, however, by giving an element this value, it makes that element as the element with respect to which all other elements are positioned i.e if we give an element this particluar value then other elements will be position relative to the position of this element. This value is usually given to a container element so that all the othere elements inside it can be positioned with respect to the inside of it. If no element is given this value, then the body tag is given relative as it's default value for the position property
	3) Absolute - This type of positioning allows us to keep whatever position we want inside of a relative element. Usually this is given to elements within a container, since we want to position the elements in any position we want inside of the container. Since the body tag is by default the relative element, with the absolute value given to the position property of an element, by default we can position our elements any where on the webpage(body of document) we want. But if we want to make it so that a conatiner is given relative element value, then we can keep it wherever we want inside the conatiner. Once we give an element absolute positionioning, then the exact position value of the element can specified with the 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' propteries, whose values will be the distance we want the element to be from the respective sides of the container. Note that these properties will only apply if and only if an element is given the value of absolute for the position property, so simply and directly writing these 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' propteries for an element will do nothing since the default value for any element for the position property is static.
	4) Fixed - This type of positioning gives an element a fixed position on the browser page, so that no matter how much we scroll, it will be on the exact same position in the browser window. You can think of this a a sort of absolute positioning, but relative to the browser window or your computer screen, and since the outside browser window/comuter screen is fixed, the position of an element is fixed, kind of like if your computer screen has a bunch of dead pixels at one corner, then no matter how much you scroll or do anything then dead pixels will stay in the same place. Just like how in absolute positioning we can specify the position of the elemnet with the 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' propteries, we can do the same for fixed positioning and the element will be positioned accordingly. Note that when we use the 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' propteries, the values we keep will be distances measured from the respective sides of the the container that the element is in.
	5) Initial - This value will reset the positioning to it's default value, which is usually static positioning. we won't be using thei much so it is best not to worry about it
	6) Inherit - This will make the element have the same positioning of it's container i.e it will cause the element to inherit the property of it's parent element (A parent element is the larger element that sorrounds smaller elements, kind of like a container element). We won't be using thei much so it is best not to worry about it.

	Once you have specified the type of positioning that will be used for positioning the element, we can then specify the actual position of the element. This is done using the 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' propteries for the element and their values will be the number of pixels that they are away from that respective side of the container that the element is in. Note that these properties will have no effect on the object if the type of positioning for the element isn't specified, therefore the first thing that we must do is to always specify the type of positioning used. The code or doing this is written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above.

<!-- Pseudo classes in CSS
	In a list, we may find it cumbersome if we want to write seperate CSS for each list item, by giving each list item it's own unique class/id and then writing CSS for each seperate class and id. Instead it is much more efficient and memory/time saving if we choose to use pseudo classes in our CSS. Pseudo classes allow us to target a specific list item in a list without having to give that specific list item a seperate class. In order to do this, we first target list items, in the CSS selector. Then we put a colon : followed by the various keywords to target different list items. The specifics keywords that target which list items are written on the styling sheet of this document that is linked above.
