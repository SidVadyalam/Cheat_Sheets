<!-- HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is a markup language, meaning it deals with the presentation, layout and styling of text. 
	An important difference between a programming and a markup langauge is logic. All programming languages have logic statements such as conditional statements and loops, but HTML is strictly presentational, i.e it's more like WISIWIG (What you see is what you get)

There are 2 main types of tags in HTML:
1. Inline elements:
When we use these tags, the content in between these tags, do not start on a newline and take the necessary width they need within a current line
Eg:
<span></span>
<strong></strong>
2. Block level elements:
When we use these tags, the content in between these tags, always start on a newline and take full width of that line.
Eg: 
<p></p>
<h1></h1>

Atributes:
Artribues are addons to HTML tags, in the sense that they provide more information and specifications about the tag. For ezample in the <a></a> tags , we write in the starting tag just after the tag name, href='link'. This is an example of an atribute and all tags have some sort of attributes. You think of attributs as the same way methords are to functions in programming. The following are some important things to remember regaurding attributes.
1. All tags have attributes
2. They are always places withing the start tag
3. They are always written as kev-value pairs, meaning the attributes will always bey of this form
<tag attributename='atributevalue'> content </tag>
In the above generalisation, attribute name is known as a key, and attributevalue is known as a value. When mentioning the value in a key value pair, it is important to remember to place the value in a set of quotaion marks, either double or single. Also we must put an = sign after writing the key
